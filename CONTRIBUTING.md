# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our Open Source Component Library! Hereâ€™s how you can get involved:

## How to Add a New Component

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it to your local machine.
2. **Create a new branch** for your component (`git checkout -b feature/add-new-component`).
3. **Add your component** in the `/src/components/` folder.
   - Ensure the component is reusable and customizable.
   - Use **TailwindCSS** for styling.
4. **Update `componentConfig.ts`**:
   - Add your new component and styles to the corresponding section.
5. **Test your component** in the live sandbox (`ComponentDemo.tsx`).
6. **Submit a Pull Request** with a clear description of your component.

## Code Style Guidelines

- We use **TailwindCSS** for all styling.
- Components should be **modular** and easy to reuse.
- Ensure your component is **documented** and includes at least two different styles.
